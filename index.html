            <h2>Naruto Uzumaki</h2>
            <p>Naruto is able to use the Wind Release: Rasengan after he molds his chakra nature into the original
                Rasengan form. Naruto's chakra affinity is Air, which gives his ninjutsu a precise cutting edge. By
                combining it with his Rasengan, he's able to create the Wind Release: Rasengan.</p>

            <h2>Madara Uchiha</h2>
            <p>As an Uchiha, Madara is able to use Fire style jutsu. Madara's fire ball jutsu can encompass a large
                distances and can swallow many opponents. Madara can also use the Wood style jutsu since he implanted
                Hashirama's cell into his body.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="jiraya.jpeg" alt="">
            <h2>Jiraiya</h2>
            <p>Jiraiya could utilise the natures of Fire, Earth, Water, Wind, Yin and Yang Release. With Fire Release,
                he could a shoot a blast of fire that he could combine with his toad's oil to make for an even more
                devastating attack. With Earth Release, he could create a swamp to trap targets in and massive defensive
                walls.</p>

            <img src="minato.jpeg" alt="">
            <h2>Minato Namikaze</h2>
            <p>JUnlike most shinobi, Minato excelled in multiple arts. While he had only 3 nature transformations, he
                excelled at high-speed combat, teleportation ninjutsu, barrier ninjutsu, taijutsu, sealing jutsu, other
                space-time ninjutsu, and even some forbidden ninjutsu.

            <h2>Kakashi Hatake </h2>
            <p>Since the eye got transplanted into him, Kakashi's ability to copy nearly any technique used against him gave him the moniker Copy Ninja Kakashi ( Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) while utilising many of the Sharingan abilities including genjutsu, seeing through deception.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="baruto.jpeg" alt="">
            <h2>Boruto Uzumaki</h2>
            <p>As an Uzumaki, Boruto is shown to have very large reserves of stamina and chakra, able to produce four shadow clones in battle before being properly trained in the Academy. Even after having most of his chakra absorbed, he still retained enough strength to fight effectively and create multiple clones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="obito.jpeg" alt="">
            <h2>Obito Uchiha</h2>
            <p>Simply put, the power of Obito's Mangekyo Sharingan is known as Kamui. With this ability, Obito gains access to a whole new dimension where he can transport things to, including himself. The ability that he possesses in his left eye and right eye differ greatly.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="shikamaru.jpeg" alt="">
            <h2>Shikamaru Nara</h2>
            <p>Shikamaru's abilities are based on the Shadow Imitation Technique (影真似の術, Kagemane no Jutsu, English TV: "Shadow Possession Jutsu"), the signature technique of his clan, with which he merges his shadow with an opponent's shadow, making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru's movements.
